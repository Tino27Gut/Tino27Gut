**`Data Analyst | Sr. Digital Transformation Consultant`**

👋🏻 I am Martín Gutiérrez, a Data Analyst with honors degrees in Business Management and Accounting. Since discovering Business Intelligence tools in my first job, I have become passionate about data analysis and its ability to generate actionable insights that drive business results.

📊 Managed over 100 initiatives through BI solutions, reducing project management times.
💎 Facilitated securing over USD 15M in funding for local and international clients.
